Page Descriptions  
This project has three pages: Home, Services, and Contact. The Home Page has a hero section with a welcome message, a two-column Flexbox layout, and a fixed navigation bar. The Services Page displays four services using CSS Grid, with hover effects for interaction. The Contact Page has a styled form with input validation and smooth animations. A hamburger menu makes navigation easy on mobile devices, and all pages are designed to be fully responsive.
  
Summary of Features Used  
The website uses CSS selectors for styling and Flexbox for the two-column layout on the Home Page. The Services Page uses CSS Grid to arrange service cards neatly. Media queries adjust the layout for tablets and mobile screens. Animations include a fade-in effect using `@keyframes` and hover effects for buttons and service cards. A JavaScript-powered hamburger menu improves mobile navigation. These features make the website responsive, interactive, and user-friendly.
